function [image] = PDCCreatePhotonImage(image,camera)% [image] = PDCCreatePhotonImage(image,camera)%% Create an image that consists of photons absorbed in an ideal% camera with same resolution as the input image.%% HISTORY:% 	9/24/98	pc		Wrote it.%   5/4/99  dhb		Rewrote to use Simulator Toolbox structures.% Create the irradiance Image.
